The state attracted 268 million visitors who spent $157 billion in 2024, creating a retail environment where every shopping center captures both local purchasing power—median household income of $100,149—and massive tourist traffic that no other state can match.

### [Nevada](https://rentail.space/state/nv)

Nevada commands a $269 billion economy with 3.27 million residents growing at 1.7% annually (6th-fastest nationally), anchored by Las Vegas's unmatched $55.1 billion tourism spending machine and zero state income tax that drives business migration from California and beyond. The state's 41.7 million visitors in 2024 spent a record $1,322 per person—52.6% above pre-pandemic levels—fueling a $87.7 billion total economic impact where tourism alone represents 37% of state GDP and supports 385,000 jobs across hospitality, entertainment, retail, and convention industries that define the Silver State's explosive growth trajectory.

### [New York](https://rentail.space/state/ny)

New York commands the third-largest economy in America with 19.5 million residents who generate $1.6 trillion in GDP annually.
